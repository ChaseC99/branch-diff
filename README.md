This extension is perfect for when you frequently switch between feature branches and want to see what files you were previously working in on that branch.

## Features

- **Autodetect parent branch**  
`Branch Diff` will automatically detect the parent branch of your current branch and show what files have changed.

- **Manually select parent branch**  
By using the "Change Parent Branch" button, you can easily update which branch your current one is compared to.

- **Refreshes automatically on file change and branch change**  
The changed files should update automatically as you work. 
If anything falls out of sync, there is also a manual refresh button.
