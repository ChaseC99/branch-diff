# Branch Diff VS Code Extension

An extension to show what files have changed compared to other branches.

## Features

Describe specific features of your extension including screenshots of your extension in action. Image paths are relative to this README file.

For example if there is an image subfolder under your extension project workspace:

> Tip: Many popular extensions utilize animations. This is an excellent way to show off your extension! We recommend short, focused animations that are easy to follow.

## Extension Settings

For example:

This extension contributes the following settings:

* `myExtension.enable`: Enable/disable this extension.
